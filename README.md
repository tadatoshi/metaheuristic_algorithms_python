# MetaheuristicAlgorithmsPython

Various metaheuristic algorithms implemented in Python.

This is equivalent to MetaheuristicAlgorithms written in Ruby (https://github.com/tadatoshi/metaheuristic_algorithms). The reason why I wrote it in Python is that I would like to potentially utilize Python's Scientific Computing libraries. 

As a programming lanugage, I prefer Ruby, because it's fully Object-Oriented programming language (also Dynamic language) and because it has a community with the culture of writing unit tests. Both of these characteristics lead to cleaner, well structured, easy-to-maintain codes. Also it's easier to understand the other people's codes written in such a way. 

But scientists use Python for their activities such as Scientific Computing, Optimization, Data Science, Data Mining, Machine Learning etc. In other words, Python has a community of scientists.
